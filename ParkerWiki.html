          <h2>Early life</h2>
          <hr>
          <p> <b>Parker Hahn </b> was born in Reading, Pennsylvania on July 8th, 2001. Parker was the first son of parents Tammy and Richard Hahn. The person writing this wikipedia page does not know much about
            Parker's life when he was really young. On April 6th, 2005, Parker's family welcomed another boy, named Spencer, making Parker an older brother. Parker attended elementary school at Spring
            Ridge Elementary School before being redistricted to Whitfield Elementary School before fifth grade. However, because of the redistricting, Parker met three of his closest friends that
            he still is friends with to this day. Parker attended middle school at Wilson West Middle School. His mom was his 6th grade math teacher at Wilson West. In middle school, Parker played
            soccer, and did track and field, throwing shot put and discus, as well as running the 200m and 4x4 relay. Parker went to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson_High_School_(Pennsylvania)">Wilson High School</a>
            from 2016 to 2020, making many memories throughout those years. In high school, Parker had exceptional grades, and was inducted into National Honors Society as a junior. Parker played soccer
            in his freshman year, scoring 11 goals but stopped playing soccer that year. As a junior, Parker started dating his current girlfriend and also created the Wilson High School Spikeball Club along
            with some of his friends. They regularly played Spikeball with each other and newer members of the club. Unfortunately, as the club started to gain traction during his senior year, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19">Covid-19</a>
            happened and Spikeball Club could not run. Parker graduated in May of 2020.
